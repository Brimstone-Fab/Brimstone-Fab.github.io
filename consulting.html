											Did you just spend thousands on new welding equipment and now you're
                                            struggling to figure out why it did not magically turn your welding 
                                            department into super heroes?
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Are you feeling the burn of inflation on your consumable costs?
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Do you think you are saving money by purchasing the cheapest welding and
                                            finishing consumables you can find?
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Are you putting together a new facility and are not sure where to start?
										</p>
                                        <p>
											Are you trying to boost your school's trades programs and can't seem to get
                                            the right support?
										</p>
                                        <p>
											We are often promised huge quality gains with the purchase of new
                                            equipment, or by switching from this vendor to that vendor. The truth
                                            is, you can, however most of your potential gains are lost due to a
                                            disengaged vendor, complacent spending, and above all lack of or poor
                                            training. Brimstone Fabrication personnel are experts are experts in
                                            the fields of welding, production management, quality management,

                                            believe in helping our manufacturing partners rather than competing
